# TheRiver
A python-based console **level chat application** with **local-level communication** and **built-in encryption**, ensuring secure message transmission.


## Get Started with  [TheRiver](https://github.com/TheGoodUser/TheRiver)
* The **TheRiver** contains mainly ```Server.py``` ,  ```@brook1```  and ```@brook2``` files, you can edit the names with you want to be connected. First you need to execute the ```python.exe server.py``` command which if says "SERVER LIVE" then its a one go, after that run the ```python.exe brook1.py``` command. These are the clients which will connect to each other through server and a message ![server live displaying image](https://i.postimg.cc/XXhgv6kr/brook-you-are-live.png) appears if everything goes fine.
* Add another client, just execute the another ```brook2.py``` file and start your chit-chatting, and if you want to add more clients, connect more friends with each just copy the brook.py and give it a name and execute the same python code again.


## Built-in Encryption
* **TheRiver** uses a built-in encryption for secure message transmission. There are two files  ```decryption.py``` and  ```encryption.py``` which uses a strong encryption for:-
  - Numbers : 0 to 9
  - Lowercase Alphabets : a to z
  - Uppercase Alphabets : A to Z only.
