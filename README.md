# TheRiver
A python-based console level chat application with local-level communication and built-in encryption, ensuring secure message transmission.


# How can you use it ?
The **TheRiver** contains mainly ```Server.py```, ```@brook1``` and ```@brook2``` files. First you need to execute the ```server.py``` file which if says "SERVER LIVE" then its a one go,
after that execute the ```brook1.py``` and/or ```brook2``` file(s). These are the clients which will connect to each other through server and a message "CLIENT-NAME you are online now".
